This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VHDL code: a missing 'else' statement in a conditional assignment within a clocked process. The code implements a simple counter, but the logic for handling the counter reaching its maximum value is incomplete, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or an off-by-one error. The solution shows the correct implementation with a proper 'else' to ensure complete counter logic.
